Hello world. My name is Lucine Oganesian and I'll be starting my PhD at the University of Southern California this fall 2020. I did my undergraduate studies at the University of California at Berkeley (go bears!) and spent the past four years working at Google as a Software Engineer. You can read more about those experiences if interested on [my personal website](lucineoganesian.com) or my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucine-oganesian-218b9b86/). In any case, hope someone finds some benefit from my meandering thoughts, technical tutorials, and other miscellaneous resources.
